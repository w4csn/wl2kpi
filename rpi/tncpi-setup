Installing TNC-Pi on rasbian

In order to use the TNC-Pi with the Raspberry Pi serial port, you will need to make a couple of changes to the Pi configuration. 

Edit the /boot/cmdline.txt file in the boot directory and make the following change:
Remove the following (if it exists): console=serial0,115200
Note: cmdline.txt is a single line of text.

Edit the /boot/config.txt file to make the following change:
Add the following: enable_uart=1

In addition, if you are using a Raspberry Pi 3 do the following (in red):
Add the following lines to /boot/config.txt:
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
core_freq=250

Add the following lines to /lib/systemd/system/hciattach.service (Note: this file does not exist in the most recent version of the OS. 
In that case, create the file in the directory listed above and copy these lines into it).:
[Unit]
ConditionPathIsDirectory=/proc/device-tree/soc/gpio@7e200000/bt_pins
Before=bluetooth.service
After=dev-ttyS0.device
[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/hciattach /dev/ttyS0 bcm43xx 921600 noflow -
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

You may have read some material on line saying the serial port will show up as ttyS0 on the Pi 3. 
The above changes will cause it to show up as port ttyAMA0, just as it did with the Pi 2 and earlier. 
Bluetooth will be moved to ttyS0.
